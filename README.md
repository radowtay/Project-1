### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Search function via User Input
* etc.


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib
* APIs
* etc. 

### Data Source:
IMDB 5000 Movie Data
https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset


### Data Cleaning:
movie_meatadata.csv was our original file. 
Cleaning Movie Data is our cleaned file. 
We removed columns that were not relevant or had little to no data. 
We Renamed the columns and reordered them to make them have a more intuitive presentation. 
We dropped any rows that had no values. 

### Questions asked :

* What movie(s) rank highest in score with the lowest budget(s)?


* Busiest Directors - most movies output in a single year
    * For this question, we found that the most movies any director had output in a single year (within the dataset) was two movies.  So, we compiled a visualization of each director that had released two in one year from 1990-2014.  Renny Harlin started the trend, but Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg both did it at least four different years.


* Busiest Actors - most movies output in a single year


* Top 5 Genres in List vs IMDB Rating


* Genres with the highest and lowest average budgets
    * We discovered that animated films have the highest average budgets!  This makes sense when one considers the amount of people and work involved in creating large-scale animation.  Within the seven genres with the lowest budgets, Romance was the highest, with Film Noir coming in dead last.


* What countries are represented in the movie dataset, and how often?
    * The first visualization to come from this was incomprehensible, due to the enormous lead the USA had in the dataset.  After we removed the US, we found the same problem with the UK.  Removing both the USA and the UK, we were left with a much more readable visualization that showed films from far lesser represented countries.  France was the lead after the USA and UK.  Finally, to represent the least-represented, we created a pie chart showing all the countries that only released one film within the dataset.
